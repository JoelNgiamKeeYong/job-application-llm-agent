## 🛠️ Solution Approach

This project automates job application emails using **Streamlit, LangChain, and ChromaDB**. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

### 1️⃣ **Extracting Job Descriptions from URLs**

- Users **enter a job posting URL** into the system.
- **Web scraping (LangChain WebBaseLoader)** extracts the job description.
- The raw job listing is **cleaned and preprocessed** to remove irrelevant text.

### 2️⃣ **Analyzing Job Requirements**

- **LangChain extracts key skills and qualifications** from the job listing.
- The model identifies relevant **skills, keywords, and role expectations**.

### 3️⃣ **Matching Skills with Portfolio (Vector Search)**

- **ChromaDB (Vector Database)** stores embeddings of **portfolio projects and experiences**.
- **Semantic search** retrieves the most **relevant projects/certifications** from the portfolio.
- Only **highly relevant** experiences are included in the final email.

### 4️⃣ **Generating a Personalized Email**

- **LangChain orchestrates the AI workflow** to draft an email.
- The email is **structured, engaging, and tailored** to the job description.
- **Key features included:**
  - Strong **opening statement**
  - Highlight of **matching skills and projects**
  - Enthusiastic and **formal tone**
  - **Closing statement** with a call to action

### 5️⃣ **User-Friendly Display in Streamlit**

- The generated email is displayed **neatly in the Streamlit UI**.
